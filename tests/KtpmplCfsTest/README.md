# KtpmplCfsTest

A PocketMine-MP plugin to test the ktpmpl-cfs virion.

**WARNING:** **Do not** use this command in **production servers**! Only use this plugin for testing or debugging purposes in development server instances. Any damages or loss by using this plugin are **not under our responsibility nor warranty** in any way.

## Usage

To start the test, first start your server. Then run the `/ktpmplcfs` command in the **console** (The command won't work in-game for security reasons). Wait until the test finishes.

If the test result outputs **SUCCESS**, the virion is working properly. Otherwise, there might be a problem with the virion, your server configuration, or this plugin. Be sure to [submit a new issue](https://github.com/KygekTeam/ktpmpl-cfs/issues) on GitHub if you get this.
